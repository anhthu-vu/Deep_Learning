# Deep_learning
This repository contains the programming exercises that I did during the practical sessions of the Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning (AMAL) course in M2A program at Sorbonne Universit√©.

In each source code file, the code between #TODO and #END TODO was written by me, while the other parts are provided.

Please refer to [the website of the course](https://dac.lip6.fr/master/amal-2024-2025/) for more details.
