In this practical session, I implemented different variants of global attention model. The models were then trained and tested on the IMDb dataset, which contains 50,000 comments (25k for training and 25k for testing) from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). The words were embedded using the GloVe embedding model. The goal was to classify a comment as positive or negative.
