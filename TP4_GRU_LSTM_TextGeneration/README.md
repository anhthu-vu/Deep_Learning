In this practical session, I implemented different types of RNNs from sratch, and then used them to build and train various models for generating text of variable lengths. To be specific:

The tp4.py files contains implementations of a traditional RNN, a GRU and a LSTM. These models are then used to build and train text generation models on the Trump dataset, which includes a collection of Trump's pre-election speeches.
The generate.py file includes various methods for text generation, such as random generation, deterministic generation, and beam search.
