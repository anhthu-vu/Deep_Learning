In this practical session, I implemented a 1D convolutional neural network and trained it on the [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) dataset. The implementation is included in the `tp8.py` file. I used the provided `tp8_preprocess.py` file to segment the dataset.

For the subject of this practical session, please refer [to the website of the course](https://dac.lip6.fr/master/amal-2024-2025/) for more details.
