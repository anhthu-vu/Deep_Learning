In this mini project, we explored Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), introduced by Z. Liu in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756), as a potential alternative to MLPs for scientific applications due to their higher level of interpretability, across different tasks including function fitting, image fitting, and classification.
