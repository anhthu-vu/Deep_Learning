In this practical session, I implemented a 1D convolutional neural network and trained it on the Sentiment10 dataset (visit https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140 for more details). The implementation is included in the tp8.py file. I used the provided tp8_preprocess.py file to segment the dataset.
