In this practical session, I implemented simple RNN, GRU and LSTM from sratch, and then used them to build and train different models or generating text of variable lengths. To be specific:

In tp4.py file, I used the RNN to build and train a classification model that takes an input sequence of the flows of metro stations in Hangzhou, and predicts which station the sequence belongs to.
In generate.py file, I implemented a simple RNN with one layer for the encoder and one layer for the decoder.
