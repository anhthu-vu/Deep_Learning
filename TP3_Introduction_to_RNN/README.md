In this practical session, I implemented a simple RNN from sratch and then used it to build and train different models for various tasks: classification, forcasting, and sequence generation. To be more specific:

- In utils.py file, I implemented a simple RNN with one layer for the encoder and one layer for the decoder.
- In exo2.py file, I used the RNN to build and train a classification model, which aims to in Hangzhou
- In exo3.py file
- In exo4.py file
