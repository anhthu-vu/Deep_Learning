In this practical session, I implemented several RNN models to perform different tasks. To be specific:

- In `tp5-tagging.py` file, I built a tagging model focusing on the task of syntactic analysis (Part-Of-Speech), using an LSTM. It will be trained on will be trained on the [GSD dataset](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_French-GSD).
- In `tp5-traduction.py` file, I build a
